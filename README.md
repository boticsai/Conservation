# Conservation
AI tools for Conservation

## Audience

The code in this repository is authored for computer-vision and machine-learning students and researchers interested in developing animal detection and conservation applications. The CNN implementation provided is intended to be used as a reference for training nets based on annotated ground-truth data; researchers may instead prefer to import captured datasets into other frameworks such as Google's TensorFlow and Caffe and optimize these algorithims using Model Optimizer from OpenVINO Toolkit. 

This project provides models trained using Microsoft Custom Vision to demonstrate Animal Species detection using video or images, for conservation projects in Botswana. Two demo Models are provided showing animal detection from a camera. Model may be found here: [Farm Animals](https://github.com/boticsai/Conservation/blob/main/Livestock.TensorFlow.zip) and [Wildlife Animals](https://github.com/boticsai/Conservation/blob/main/Conservation.TensorFlow.zip)
